# Cloud Slice Quick Start - Configure Cloud Provider

Estimated time to completion: **5-20 minutes**.

This is the first in a series of Quick Starts about Cloud Slice functionality in the OneLearn Lab on Demand platform (LOD).

In this Quick Start, you will give LOD permissions to a subscription or account on a cloud provider that you want to use for Cloud Slice labs.

> [!ALERT] As a best practice, any cloud provider subscription or account that you configure for use with Cloud Slice labs should be dedicated for that purpose. This practice keeps cloud resources used for learning separate from cloud resources that you may use for other test or production purposes. It also helps isolates expenses associated with Cloud Slice labs from expenses you may incur related to other cloud resources.

Depending on which cloud provider you are using, granting LOD access to a cloud provider can be a tedious process. Fortunately, you only have to go through it once for each cloud provider subscription or account that you want to use, so let's roll up our sleeves and get started.

Select the cloud provider that you want to use with Cloud Slice and follow the steps to configure a subscription or account for that cloud provider.

1. [Microsoft Azure](configure-cloud-provider-azure.md).
1. [Amazon Web Services](configure-cloud-provider-aws.md).
1. Google Cloud Platform (coming soon).

Now that you have configured your cloud provider properly, click on the link below to go through the next Quick Start where you will setup cloud resource management in LOD, allowing it to manage Cloud Slice and managed VM deployments using your cloud provider.
