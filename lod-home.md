# OneLearn Lab on Demand Help

Welcome to the OneLearn Lab on Demand platform (LOD), @lab.UserFirstName!

Are you new to LOD? Check out our [Introduction to the LOD experience](lod/feature-focus/lod-experience.md).

If you're keen on getting started, and want to hit the ground running, have a look at [Quick Starts](#quick-starts).

After you have gone through some of the Quick Starts, or if you simply want to learn more about a specific feature in LOD, [Feature Focus](#feature-focus) will provide you with in-depth information about a feature.

If you've already read through all of the documentation that is available on a topic, and you are still looking for more information, or have questions, check out the resources available to you on our [Contact Us](contact-us.md) page.

We hope this documentation helps you create awesome labs!

## Quick Starts

Quick Starts allow you to fast track your learning experience, helping you get more value from the platform as quickly as possible.

### Building your first Cloud Slice lab

With the Cloud Slice feature, LOD is able to support cloud learning at scale. Learners are provided with a slice of a cloud subscription that they can use for the duration of their learning experience, limited however you configure it. This series of Quick Starts will walk you through every step required to create a feature-rich Cloud Slice lab.

### Getting Started With Life Cycle Actions

With the Life Cycle Actions feature, LOD is able to execute actions when specific events occur during the lab instance life cycle. Each of these action types will be covered, in this series of Quick Starts. We will discuss how to use each action, and when it is appropriate to use each one. After completing this Quick Start series, you will be able to configure your lab with Life Cycle Actions, to make your more lab a more rich experience for students.

## Feature Focus

Feature Focus helps you learn more in-depth about specific features in LOD.

### Lab Profiles

Lab Profiles integrate a set of resources (cloud resources, virtualized resources, websites, videos, images, supplementary documents and/or files) with instructions and configuration options, providing anyone who launches the lab with a rich learning experience. You include an exam if you want to reinforce what people have learned from the lab. They can exist on their own, or be presented as part of a Lab Series. Everything related to how the lab is built and presented is defined in the lab profile.

LOD provides a "blank canvas" approach to the design of a lab profile. This flexibility allows you to build whatever learning experience you want for consumers of your lab.

To learn more about how to do something with Lab Profiles, click an Action link from one of the lists below.

Or, you can learn more about a specific setting in [Lab Profile settings](lod/feature-focus/lab-profiles/settings.md).
